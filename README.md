## Introduction
DNA sequencing is a laboratory technique used to determine the sequence of bases (A, C, G, and T) in a DNA molecule. It helps to identify some major diseases (Alzheimer, Cancer) in early condition before it gets critical. DNA sequence can be determined by many ways and NGS is one of the most popular ways to identify them. 
Our projectâ€™s aim is to create a tool which is identify the one of the major disease Alzheimer by using the given input DNA sequence dataset.

## Project Objectives
There is lack of tools to analyze DNA molecules to identify biomarker for rare diseases. Cost and time for detecting biomarkers are also high. Alzheimer has become Sixth most leading death cause in world. So, identifying the patients of Alzheimer in early condition is very important.

## Solution
Give the fully functional tool to analyze the DNA sequences and identify the Biomarker for the Alzheimer disease in cost and time efficient manner.

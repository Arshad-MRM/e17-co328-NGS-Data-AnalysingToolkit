# Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysing Toolkit
___

## Introduction
The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has resulted in a rapid growth in the synthesis of large genomic datasets, but user-friendly tools for finding biomarkers of genes and visualizing this data have not kept pace. 
Our project is to develop a web application which can provide a user-friendly interface for Alzheimer disease prediction and finding biomarker genes for particular disease using differential expression analysis of human mRNA sequence data. We improve on available tools by offering a range of normalization, feature selection and classification methods and a simple to use interface.

## Project Objectives
There is lack of tools to analyze DNA molecules to identify biomarker for rare diseases. Cost and time for detecting biomarkers are also high. Alzheimer has become Sixth most leading death cause in world. So, identifying the patients of Alzheimer in early condition is very important.

## Solution
Give the fully functional tool to analyze the DNA sequences and identify the Biomarker for the Alzheimer disease in cost and time efficient manner.

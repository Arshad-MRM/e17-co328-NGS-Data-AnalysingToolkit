Requirements
	1. Functional Requirements
	--> System Should be able to detect all the biomarkers for a ceratain disease when ".csv" or ".xlrd" files uploaded
	--> User able to login with the credentials and able to manage his/her files and datas.
	--> User able to visualize the data using different methods(Box plot, Scatter plot)
	--> User able to normalize the data.
	--> user able to use different feature selection methods(Selected few)
	--> User able to use different classification methods to classify the person as diseased or not
 

	2. Non Functional requirements
	--> For handling vast amount of data the sytem should be utilized.
	--> Time taken to detect the biomarkers need to minimize as much as possible.
	--> User data's need to recoverable.
	--> Scalability of the system should be high inorder to handle a huge amount of data.
	--> System should be available 24/7.
	--> Able to access across the globe.
